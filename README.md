# Wind Tunnel via Inductiva API

Wind tunnels are central for the development and testing of vehicle aerodynamics -
from your everyday commuter car to the high-performance F1 car.
With **Inductiva API** users can simplify their simulation workflow and build their
custom virtual wind tunnels to accelerate the discovery of new designs.

In this repository, we assume users are familiar with one of the most popular
open-source simulators for virtual wind tunnels, [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.org).
If not, we advise to get acquainted with it through the classical
[motorbike tutorial](https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-8/tree/master/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/motorBike).

## Virtual wind tunnel simulations

When performing wind tunnel tests - virtual or physical - only a few
parameters are tweaked, for example, changing the airflow velocity for the same
vehicle.
**Inductiva API** provides a powerful mechanism to configure this simulation
from this set of parameters, this workflow is designated as
a **simulation scenario**.

Let's set an F1 car in a toy **wind tunnel** and run a simulation scenario:

```python
from lib import models
from lib import scenarios

# Create a model of  a wind tunnel with a flow velocity of 30 m/s
# and a domain of 18x8x8 m
wind_tunnel = models.WindTunnel(
    flow_velocity=(30, 0, 0),
    x_min=-3, x_max=15, y_min=-4, y_max=4, z_min=0, z_max=8)

# Initialize a scenario with the wind tunnel
wind_tunnel_scenario = scenarios.WindTunnelScenario(wind_tunnel)

# Establish the num_iterations and resolution via the simulation parameters
sim_params = scenarios.SimulationParameters(num_iterations=100, resolution=2)

# Submit a non-blocking simulation task
task = wind_tunnel_scenario.simulate(object_path="assets/f1_car.obj",
                                     sim_params=sim_params)
```

In this code snippet, we are using the `WindTunnelScenario` to configure the
simulation files for OpenFOAM with the `wind_tunnel` model, the F1 car and
simulation parameters and simulating via **Inductiva API**. This scenario is a
toy example that can be extended to more complex simulation scenarios, (e.g.,
add rotation of wheels to the vehicle). 

In this repository, users will learn how to create a simulation scenario from a
low-level OpenFOAM call via **Inductiva API** to a higher-level structure within
a Python class.

Before starting, make sure to have the `inductiva` package installed and
follow the instructions in the [installation section](docs/0_INSTALL.md).

The **wind tunnel** tour is split into the following steps:
1. [Running OpenFOAM simulations via Inductiva API](docs/1_OPENFOAM_SIM.md)
2. [Templating your simulation files to introduce simple configuration](docs/2_TEMPLATING.md)
3. [Creating a custom wind tunnel scenario with Python](docs/3_WINDTUNNEL_SCENARIO.md)
4. [Submiting many simulations to the API](docs/4_BATCH_WIND_TUNNELS.md). You can then [monitor the status of the tasks](docs/5_MONITOR_TASKS.md) submitted to the API.

**Disclaimer**: For the sake of time the simulations performed here are simple and
don't represent any practical real-world application.
