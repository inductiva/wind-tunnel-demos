### Batch wind tunnel examples

The script `batch_wind_tunnels.py` submits
`NUM_SIMULATIONS_PER_OBJECT` of the same object to the API. It does
that by randomly choosing the wind speed within the given ranges. To
change the nehaviour of the script tha global variables can be
changed.

Additionally, feel free to replace the `OBJECT_PATH` with your own
objects to run simulations on them instead.
