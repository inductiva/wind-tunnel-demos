"""Physical scenario of a configurable wind tunnel simulation.

A wind tunnel is a tool used in aerodynamic research to study the
effects of air moving past solid objects. Here, the tunnel consists
of a box object in 3D space (x, y, z) space, where air flows in the
positive x-direction with a certain velocity.

An arbitrary object is placed within the tunnel, sucht that air flows
around it, as illustrated in the schematic below:
|--------------------------------|
|->          _____               |
|->        _/     |              |
|->_______|_o___O_|______________|

This scenario solves steady-state continuity and momentum equations
(time-independent) with incompressible flow.
The simulation solves the time-independent equations for several
time steps, based on the state of the previous one. The end goal is
to determine the steady-state of the system, i.e., where the flow
does not change in time anymore.

Currently, the following variables are fixed:
- The fluid being inject is air.
- The flow is incompressible (this restricts the max air velocity).
- Air only flows in the positive x-direction.
- Some post-processing of the data occurs at run-time: streamlines,
pressure_field, cutting planes and force coefficients.
